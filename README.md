The project is spited by:

- `pages`: responsible for having each page the project contains.
- `components`: responsible for containing the sharable components. In the case, that the component has more complexity the component folder could contain an internal `component` folder, a `hook`, `type` etc.
- `constants`: has the sharable values which are used inside the application
- `hooks`: has the sharable `hooks` which all pages or components can take advantage
